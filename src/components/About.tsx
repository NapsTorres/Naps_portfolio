        <p>
          I am a multi-disciplinary IT professional specializing in data engineering, data analytics, and IT
          infrastructure. I have experience working with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SQL, R, and Orange to
          process data, build insights, and support data-driven solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my data expertise, I have hands-on experience in network configuration, system
          administration, and IT support, enabling me to manage and troubleshoot real-world infrastructure
          environments efficiently. I have also developed modern web applications using the MERN stack, allowing me
          to build full-stack solutions that integrate both software and data capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary career focus is to grow in roles such as Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and IT Specialist, while
          continuously expanding my expertise in network engineering, cloud technologies, and system
          administration. I am passionate about delivering secure, scalable, and innovative solutions that bridge data,
          software, and infrastructure.
